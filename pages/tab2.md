  <li> <a class="highlighted">Quadrotor Navigating through Multiple Arbitrary Shaped Window gaps in a drone racing like scenario:</a>
The objective was to navigate a quadrotor in a drone racing like scenario which contains a number of arbitrary shaped window gaps. Some window gaps are smaller than the quadrotor size whereas some are larger than the quadrotor size. Quadotor should be able to navigate without any prior information about the shape, size and location about the window gaps.
