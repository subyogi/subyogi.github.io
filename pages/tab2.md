  <li> <a class="highlighted">Development of a Vision-guided Quadrotor for Search and Rescue Operation inside a building:</a>
     The objective  was to develop a fully onboard implementable approach to autonomously entering into the building, perform search operation i.e. taking pictures of inner environment and come back to the initial takeoff position.

  <li> <a class="highlighted">Software and Hardware Development of Quadrotor with Static and Moving Platform Landing:</a>
The objective was to customize a quadrotor from scratch to fix 2 cameras, onboard computer, battery, landing gear in a compact way. Main task was to have navigation facility in GPS-denied environment. In addition, the quadrotor should be able to land precisely on both static and moving vehicles.

  <li> <a class="highlighted">Quadrotor Navigating through Multiple Arbitrary Shaped Window gaps in a drone racing like scenario:</a>
The objective was to navigate a quadrotor in a drone racing like scenario which contains a number of arbitrary shaped window gaps. Some window gaps are smaller than the quadrotor size whereas some are larger than the quadrotor size. Quadotor should be able to navigate without any prior information about the shape, size and location about the window gaps.

  <li> <a class="highlighted">Linux based GUI development for Indoor Quadrotor Navigation:</a>
The objective was to develop a GUI for automonous operations in indoor environments. These operations include: autonomous takeoff and landing, track predefind waypoints, make circle at any flying position, live camera feed, send set-points by clicking on a grid (grid size can be set based on operating environment size). The codes for trajectory generation and control were written from scratch.
